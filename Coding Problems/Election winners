find the number of candidates who still have the chance to win the election.
INPUT:
[2,3,5,2]
K=3
OUTPUT:
2

code in python:

l=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
k=int(input())                           #no of voters still left to vote
l.sort(reverse=True)
m=max(l)
CountForWinner=0
for i in l:
    if m-i<3:
        CountForWinner=CountForWinner+1
print(CountForWinner)
